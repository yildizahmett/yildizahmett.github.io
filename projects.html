      <h3>Spine Posture Detection Using Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>My friend and I embarked on an innovative project where we worked together to design a system that employs advanced machine learning algorithms to identify poor spine posture. Our main goal was to develop a reliable and precise system capable of recognizing misalignments in the spine, with the aim of enhancing posture awareness and potentially preventing associated health issues. The resulting system has great potential for raising awareness about spinal health, particularly in situations where individuals may not have immediate access to healthcare professionals. By accurately identifying instances of bad spine posture, the system can promptly provide feedback to users, motivating them to improve their posture and adopt healthier habits. This collaborative project successfully created a system that utilizes advanced machine learning methods to detect improper spine posture. The system's ability to accurately classify spine postures represents a significant advancement in the promotion of better posture and awareness of spinal health. It serves as a testament to the positive impact of technology on public health and underscores the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation in addressing real-world health-related challenges.</p>

    <div id="Project2" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Silver</h3>
      <p>A jewelry-focused e-commerce platform designed for both dealers and workshops. Dealers have the flexibility to place orders for any quantity of jewelry they desire, while workshops can access these orders and craft the requested items. This website was developed using Flask and PostgreSQL.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Project3" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>MEF MOOC</h3>
      <p>This website is specifically designed to address the challenge of students selecting online course bundles to fulfill their elective course requirements. Students have the capability to assemble bundles, which instructors can review and either endorse or decline. This project is developed for MF University as part of a class assignment, and it utilizes Flask and PostgreSQL for its implementation.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Project4" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>UP School</h3>
      <p>A platform resembling LinkedIn, where students and alumni can input their details to showcase themselves to prospective employers in their job search. Companies have the ability to sort through student profiles to identify the talents they need. This website was constructed using Flask and PostgreSQL.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Project5" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Multimodal Fake News Detection</h3>
      <p>In this project, I created a fake news detection system that utilizes both textual and visual elements from news articles, embracing a multimodal approach. The project highlighted the critical role of multimodal data analysis and the importance of feature engineering in the realm of machine learning. It underscored the significance of feature engineering in the context of machine learning, particularly when dealing with multimodal data analysis. The project also exemplified the importance of multimodal data analysis, harnessing both textual and visual attributes to enhance overall performance. Valuable insights were gained from the project regarding the trade-offs between various feature engineering techniques and the significance of multimodal data analysis, all of which contribute to the advancement of machine learning and data science.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Project6" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Private Sensitive Content Detection</h3>
      <p>In this endeavor, I developed a system for detecting sensitive content within news articles, using a combination of text and visual cues. The project underscored the crucial role of feature engineering in machine learning and highlighted the value of analyzing data from multiple sources. It emphasized the necessity of effective feature engineering in machine learning, especially when dealing with data that combines both textual and visual elements. The project also underscored the importance of multimodal data analysis, which harnesses both text and visual features to achieve superior performance. Ultimately, the project yielded valuable insights into the trade-offs among various feature engineering methods and the significance of multimodal data analysis, contributing to the advancement of machine learning and data science.</p>
